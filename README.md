Sunshine
========

Sunshine is the companion Android app for the Udacity course [Developing Android Apps: Android Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853).

Take the course to find out how to build this app a step at a time, and eventually create your own Android App!

This is my version of Sunshine which is a rebuilt version of the original. It implements several changes including:
- Revamped the layouts to fit better with material design
- Implemented a two pane landscape view (Originally, there was no landscape view implementation)
- Added/Fixed default weather options (In landscape view, today is selected as default)
- Optimised for mobile devices
